    Before reporting problems please read the <a target="_blank" href="https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Overview">user documentation</a>.

    <h4>Finding the expected result</h4>

    First of all, please make sure that the result that you expect is
    available in the OpenStreetMap data.

    To find the OpenStreetMap data, do the following:

    <ul>
     <li>Go to <a href="https://openstreetmap.org">https://openstreetmap.org</a>.</li>
     <li>Go to the area of the map where you expect the result
         and zoom in until you see the object you are looking for.</li>
     <li>Click on the question mark on the right side of the map,
         then with the question cursor on the map where your object is located.</li>
     <li>Find the object of interest in the list that appears on the left side.</li>
     <li>Click on the object and note down the URL that the browser shows.</li>
    </ul>

    If you cannot find the data you are looking for, there is a good chance
    that it has not been entered yet. You should <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/fixthemap">report or fix the problem in OpenStreetMap</a> directly.

    <h4>Reporting bad searches</h4>

          were searching for.</li>
